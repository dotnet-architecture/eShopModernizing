# eShopModernizing web applications
This repo provides two sample hypothetical legacy eShop web apps (traditional ASP.NET WebForms and MVC  in .NET Framework) and how you can modernize them (Lift and Shift scenario) with Windows Containers and Azure Cloud into the following deployment options:
- Regular Windows Server 2016 VM (Virtual Machine)
- ACS-Kubernetes orchestrator cluster
- Service Fabric orchestrators cluster

All those mentioned environments can be deployed into Azure cloud (as explained in the Wiki) but you can also deploy all those environments into on-premises servers or even in other public clouds.

The modernization with Windows Containers significantly improves the deployments for DevOps, without having to change the app's architecture or C# code.

The sample apps are simple web apps for the internal backoffice of an eShop so employees can update the Product Catalog. 
Both apps are therefore simple CRUD web application to update data into a SQL Server database. 

See a screenshots of both apps below.

### UI and business features

The WebFoms and MVC apps are pretty similiar in regards UI and business features. We just created both versions so you can compare, depending on what technology you are using for your existing apps (ASP.NET MVC or Web Forms).

### Choose in-memory mock-data or real database connection to a SQL Server database
The apps allow either to connect to the real database to get/update the product catalog or to use mock-data if, due to any reason, the database is still not available and you need to test/demo the app. 

For each application, the option to select one or the other mode can be configured in the docker-compose.override.yml file when using Windows Containers or at the `Web.config` file when you still are NOT using Containers (original versions).


## Additional apps to modernize: WCF services and WinForms desktop apps 
We're also creating an additonal modernization example based on a "legacy apps" which has a client WinForms desktop application and a SOAP service built with WCF (Windows Communication Foundation). You can explore it at the following GitHub repo:
